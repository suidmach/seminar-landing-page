                    <p>Over the past 20 years, I've helped more than 1,500 families buy their first home and funded over $1 billion in mortgages.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've seen too many first-time buyers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Miss out on $50-70K in rebates they qualified for</li>
                        <li>Get bad advice that cost them tens of thousands</li>
                        <li>Walk away thinking they "can't afford" to buy when they absolutely could</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>That's why I created this seminar.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>I want to give you the insider knowledge that separates the families who save $70K from the ones who overpay.</p>
                    
                    <p>No charge. No pressure. Just straight talk from someone who's been doing this for two decades.</p>
                    
                    <p class="credentials">I'm a Mortgage Development Manager with National Bank of Canada, where I've worked for over 20 years. My job is to help people like you navigate what can be a confusing, overwhelming process—and do it in a way that saves you money and sets you up for success.</p>
