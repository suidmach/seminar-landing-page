## Important Legal Notes:

Since you're NOT a licensed mortgage broker:

✅ **You CAN:**
- Run educational seminars
- Share general mortgage information
- Explain programs and rebates
- Work under National Bank's umbrella
- Say "I work with National Bank"

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Call yourself a "Mortgage Broker"
- Use licensing numbers you don't have
- Advertise as independent
- Make guarantees about approvals

**What you're doing (educational seminars) is PERFECT and compliant.**

You're:
- Clearly identifying as National Bank employee
- Focusing on education, not product sales
- Making no specific rate/approval promises
- Positioned as expert/educator

This is EXACTLY the right approach for a bank employee.
